        <p class="foundingp">Nottingham Forest Football Club was founded in 1865 in the heart of Nottingham, England.
        Originally created by a group of local cricketers looking for a sport to play during the winter,
        the club quickly became a cornerstone of the local community. In its early years, Forest played 
        friendly matches against nearby teams, gradually building a reputation for skill and sportsmanship.
        The club’s first official ground, on a small plot near the city center, became a gathering place for fans,
        laying the foundation for the passionate support that continues to this day.</p>
